victory.8.b: "Better safe than sorry: see that no foreign power is trying to undermine our regime."

victory.9.name: "Trade Expansion - After Action Report"
victory.9.desc.accepted: "After our empire was first in breaching the psychological barrier of producing more than 350 credits from trade revenues, a big push to expand trade has taken place in every other countries. As a majority of them eneacted legislation to §Gfavor§! international investments, we can now reap the benefits!"
victory.9.desc.rejected: "After our empire was first in breaching the psychological barrier of producing more than 350 credits from trade revenues, a big push to expand trade has taken place in every other countries.

sublimation.2.name: "Space-time continuum rupture detected"
sublimation.2.desc: "We have detected a strong space-time event taking place in §B[From.GetName]§! space. We believe they have found a way to intereact with the meta-dimension and have now completed preliminary experiments to start a new field of studies."
sublimation.2.a: "Unbelievable!"
sublimation.2.b: "Another one joins the club..."

sublimation.3.name: "A (worrying) success!"
sublimation.3.desc: "The experiment to determine the existence of the theorethical meta-dimension was §Ysuccessful§!. Our scientists managed to send a message into it and got it back at the expected exit point, confirming that black holes can be used as entry points, while pulsars manage to echo the signal through the galaxy.\n\nWhat really surprised (and somewhat alarmed) the scientific community is that our §Ysignal was received and interpreted as an instruction by the meta-dimension§!, which appears to have complied...\n\nAs we were trying to connect our emitter and receiver stations, the meta-dimension interpreted our signal as an order and made space-time reality re-adjust itself... so §Ynow a new wormhole pair connects our two systems§!...\n\nThis leads to many new questions about this newfound dimension: could it be possible to §Ydecipher a universal reality-programming language§!? Would it be possible to take advantage of this?\n\nFinally, it seems that since we sent the first message, the entry black hole has somehow changed: it now appears to be §Yready to process new instructions§!, but we believe it will randomly accept and process random signals without discrimination, so §Yanything can happen until we learn more!§!"
sublimation.3.a: "We must hurry to understand how to tame this new Pandora's box!"

sublimation.5.name: "Reverse engineering complete"
sublimation.5.desc: "We did it!\n\nWe managed to complete a the reverse engineering of the §Ysource code of this universe§! - we believe that this reality is like a game, where programmers set up rules to follow by a compilator well hidden behind the screen of the recently discovered meta-dimension!\n\nNow, like for standard video-games, we stand ready to start a §Yhuge modding project§!, one that will enable us to rewrite every rule as we please...\n\nOh, there is more: with our new understanding we can control which kind of information filters through our black hole back-door, so §Yno more wild reality fluctuations§! are to be caused by us. Moreover, we found and §Yfixed a certain numbers of bugs§!... obviously we may found this very advantageous (*WINK, WINK*)"
sublimation.5.a: "Wonderful! Let's write a good mod..."

sublimation.6.name: "Disturbing news"
sublimation.6.desc: "It seems that §B[From.GetName]§! scientists reverse engineered the universal code of this universe. Who can tell what they can be up to, now that they have the keys to unlimited knowledge?"
sublimation.6.a: "Worrying."

sublimation.7.name: "Ready to reboot the system"
sublimation.7.desc: "Our efforts in writing down a new mod have been successful. Now we only need a strong enough computational engine to pre-compile and send it to the meta-dimension, something like a complete §BScience Nexus§!, for example..."
sublimation.7.a: "N o i c e"

sublimation.10000.name: "Becoming Gods"
sublimation.10000.desc: "The reboot is underway - nobody can stop it now. In seconds, we will leave behind this flawed reality and start anew on a different plane of existence, where we'll be like §WGods!§!\n\nThanks to your leadership we achieved something unimaginable... what are your last words before Subliming?"
sublimation.10000.a: "Let there be light!"

sublimation.10001.name: "Catastrophe"
sublimation.10001.desc: "All comms from the §B[From.GetName]§! empire are now silent. Preliminary images shows that all their citizens disappeared, and all their colonies are now deserted.\nSir, we believe they were able to §WSublimate§! to a new reality, sealing us behind in this universe..."
sublimation.10001.a: "This is the worst!"

sublimation.100.name: "Energy surge"
sublimation.100.desc: "We believe that the meta-dimensional compilator interpreted a random radio signal (...actually a commercial about some new batteries...) as instructions to increase the efficiency of energy generators..."
sublimation.100.a: "Let's hope for the best..."
sublimation.101.name: "Energy surge"
sublimation.101.desc: "We believe that the meta-dimensional experiments of §B[From.GetName]§! have caused a surge in our energy production!"
sublimation.101.a: "This is good!"

sublimation.200.name: "Fertility surge"
sublimation.200.desc: "We believe that the meta-dimensional compilator interpreted a private conversation between two lovers... as instructions to increase the rate of birth on some planet..."

sublimation.201.desc: "We believe that the meta-dimensional experiments of §B[From.GetName]§! have caused a surge in our population fertility rate!"
sublimation.201.a: "This is good!"

sublimation.300.name: "Subatomic strongness surge"
sublimation.300.desc: "Somehow a new study on using strong isotopes on alloys production made its way to the meta-dimensional compilator... causing minerals to be very strong at molecular level, but also very difficult to transform into something else..."
sublimation.300.a: "This is a joke..."
sublimation.301.name: "Subatomic strongness surge"
sublimation.301.desc: "We believe that the meta-dimensional experiments of §B[From.GetName]§! have caused a surge in our minerals molecular strenght!"
sublimation.301.a: "This has to stop!"

sublimation.400.name: "Researchers' nightmare"
sublimation.400.desc: "We believe that the meta-dimensional compilator interpreted a bunch of inconclusive raw data submitted for a pre-print on the Journal of Galactic Chemistry as instructions to make everything incomprehensible..."
sublimation.400.a: "Luckily they weren't the minutae from the last session of the Galactic Council..."

sublimation.500.name: "Military dreams come... true"
sublimation.500.desc: "A top-secret trasmission of battle scenarios had been received by the meta-dimensional compiler... which acted accordingly and transformed a planet into a nuclear wasteland!"
sublimation.500.a: "Let's hope it wasn't one of ours..."
sublimation.501.name: "Military dreams come... true"
sublimation.501.desc: "We believe that the meta-dimensional experiments of §B[From.GetName]§! have made one of our colonies into a nuclear hell-hole!"
