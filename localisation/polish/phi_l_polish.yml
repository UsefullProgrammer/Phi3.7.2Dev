Would it be possible to take advantage of this?\n\nFinally, it seems that since we sent the first message, the entry black hole has somehow changed: it now appears to be §Yready to process new instructions§!, but we believe it will randomly accept and process random signals without discrimination, so §Yanything can happen until we learn more!§!"
